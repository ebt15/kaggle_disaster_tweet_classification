# Twitter Disaster Tweets Prediction

This repository contains a Python notebook where I explore and implement various models to tackle the 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets' Kaggle Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to predict which tweets are related to real disasters and which ones are not.

## Kaggle Challenge

You can find more details about the challenge [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started).

## Models

The following models are implemented and their results are compared:

1. Baseline model 1- TFiDF + MultiNomial NaviBayes
2. Model 2 - Dense Model
3. Model 3- LSTM
4. Model 4 - GRU
5. Model 5- BiLSTM
6. Model 6 - Covn 1D
7. Model 7 - TFHub USE + Logistic Regression

Please note that this Python notebook is just an exploration and not intended to be the solution. If you are looking for perfect solutions, you can find them in the code section of the Kaggle challenge.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Credits

The idea to do such a project is taken from the TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery course on Udemy by Daniel Bourke and Andrei Neagoie. You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/).
